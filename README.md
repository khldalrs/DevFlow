# Devoverflow

**An AI-enhanced community platform for developers**

## Introduction

Devoverflow is a community-driven platform inspired by StackOverflow, enhanced with AI-powered answers, gamification, personalized recommendations, and more. This project is built with **Next.js**, a framework based on React. It is a full-stack application that handles both the frontend design and logic, as well as the backend database and API routes.

Several key concepts that make Next.js unique were implemented in this project:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Renders pages on the server for improved performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-renders pages at build time for faster load times.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Updates static content after deployment without a full rebuild.
- **API Routes:** Creates a robust backend API within the Next.js framework.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Provides clean, SEO-friendly URLs for user profiles, questions, and tags.
